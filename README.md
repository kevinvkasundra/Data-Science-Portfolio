## Projects: 
- **Machine Learning**

     - [Prediction Analysis of Risky Credit for a credit card company using Neural Networks and Random Forests]() : Developed a model to determine the credit risk for a customer based on the attributes. Performed data imputations using one-hot method. The Random Forest model resulted in accuracy of 78%, recall of 93.24%, precision of 80.23% and F1 score of 86.25%. The training model for Random forest however shows 95.71% accuracy and overfitting of curve. Hence, we rely on neural network with Neural Network (MLPClassifier) - (6,5).  
     - [Natural Language Processing using NLTK on eBooks]() : There are 8 different text files of ebooks which are available freely on http://www.gutenberg.org/ . Steps Performed: Importing of text files to python, Text Parsing and transformation operations are performed such as lowercase conversion, removal of special characters, contraction words, tokenizing etc., Tagging parts of speech to each term, Stemming terms to get their root word, Stop Word Removal. The project also shows the difference in the outcome when POS Tagging, Stop Word Removal and Stemming operations are not performed.
     - [Text Analytics]() : Parsed and Filtered text reviews of wine and hotels. Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and SVD – Latent Semantic Analysis to classify and analyze text topics. Also analyzed the sentiments of the group of reviews for hotels and quantified the sentiments using AFINN Sentiment Lexicon.
     - [GMC car crash regression model using Text complaints]() : Utilized the text complaints to form 8 topic clusters using LDA. Formulated the model to predict probability of crash using Stepwise Logistic Regression and Decision Tree where predictors included the topic clusters as well as other vehicle attributes.
     - [Mine-Rock classifier based on Sonar data inputs]() : Utilized a sonar data inputs (signals bouncing off from metal and rock surfaces). I have used analysis for outlier and missing value identification and imputation.  A classification model is built to detect if the signals contribute or predict the presence of a Mine or a Rock.
     - [Data Analytics of Diamond Pricing and its associated features]() : Built a linear regression model in order to accurately predict the diamond prices based on the features. The features are Price, Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Depth, Tabl, X, Y, and Z dimensions. The Data consists of many missing values which are assessed and analysed in order to proceed for model building. Objectives included Metadata Preparation, Outlier Analysis, Missing Value Imputation, New Attribute Creation and Attribute Encoding.
     - Data Analytics and exploration of Diamond pricing in SAS : Performed outlier analysis, missing value imputation, attribute encoding, determined important features responsible for diamond pricing. Performed forward -backward and stepwise linear regressions to predict the diamond pricing.
     - [Prediction of the file claim for an insured car in R](): Built and implemented a claim predictive model where the claim rate was less than 2% of the entire dataset. Data profiling and cleansing along with modifying the data using Resampling techniques followed by PCA. Formulated the classification model using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Linear SVM and Random Forest.
     - [Profiling and Analyzing Yelp Data in SQL]() : Analyzed and made ratings predictions of various businesses in the Yelp dataset based on texts reviews.
     - [Boston Housing price model]() : Developed a realistic regression model to determine the prices of houses in Boston suburban. Summarized the result to give an in-depth executive summary.
     - [Ranking NFL 2007 teams using Markov Chain]() : Applied W/L score, Random Walk, and difference of W/L points criteria to form transition matrix. 
     - [‘CFD Analysis of Wind Turbine’, Undergrad Thesis Project]() : Analyzed and optimized the attributes affecting the wake region of a Wind Turbine and compared the results with the WInDS code in MATLAB.
     - [Production Demand Forecasting (Long & Short) for Arconic Fastening Systems & Rings (Fortune 250)]() : Implemented Moving average, Exponential smoothing, Croston’s method, ARIMA and Winter Holt’s methods to forecast production demands. Cross verified the forecasts using Facebook Prophet Algorithm.
     - [Inventory Management for VTI of Texas]() : Calculated ‘when and how much’ stock; truck load optimization.
     - [Time Series analysis using Neural Networks]() : 
     - [LA Bicycle Share]() : 
     - [Data Mining]() : 
     - [Google Maps using API]() : 



- **Visualization**
