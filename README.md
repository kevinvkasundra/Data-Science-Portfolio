## Projects: 
- **Machine Learning**

   - [Prediction Analysis of Risky Credit for a credit card company using Neural Networks and Random Forests](https://github.com/kevinvkasundra/Credit-Risk-Modelling/blob/master/Risky_Credit.ipynb) : Developed an optimiser using Forward Neural Network and Random Forest to classify customers and their risk of default based on Credit history data (20 attributes). Parameters like number of neurons, configurations and learning rate are varied in FNN while max depth and number of trees varied in Random Forest. We use Cross Validation method to find the best model from both NN and RF. Achieved F-1 score of 84.89% in NN using the config (8,7) with alpha =0.3 and F-1 score of 87.10% using tress=100 and max depth =10 in Random Forest on the validation set. 
   - [Natural Language Processing (NLP) using NLTK on eBooks](https://github.com/kevinvkasundra/NLP-using-NLTK-on-Ebooks/blob/master/code.ipynb) : There are 8 different text files of ebooks which are available freely on http://www.gutenberg.org/ . Steps Performed: Importing of text files to python, Text Parsing and transformation operations such as lowercase conversion, removal of special characters, contraction words, tokenizing etc., Tagging parts of speech to each term, Stemming terms to get their root word, Stop Word Removal. The project also shows the difference in the outcome when POS Tagging, Stop Word Removal and Stemming operations are not performed.
   - [Descriptive Analysis of Cabernet Sauvignon Wines from California](https://github.com/kevinvkasundra/Descriptive-Analysis-of-Cabernet-Sauvignon-Wines-from-California/blob/master/TextAnalytics_wine.ipynb) : 9 distinct topic cluster were formed using 13136 text reviews of wine. Parsed (tokenization & POS tagging) and Filtered (stop-word removal & stemming) the text reviews to build the term/doc matrix. The matrix was weighted using TF_IDF. Applied latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and SVD - latent semantic analysis to classify and analyze topic clusters. Further calculated region wise average price and points of wine. Last but not the least calculated contribution region wise contribution to each topic cluster.
   - [Vehicle crash prediction model for GMC using filed complaints]() : Formulated the model to predict probability of crash of a GMC vehicle using Stepwise Logistic Regression and Decision Tree where predictors included the cluster wise topic probability, year, make, model, ABS and mileage of the car. The text complaints were pre-processed using text parsing and filtering. Further we used LDA to form 8 topic clusters and their cluster wise probability which were utilized in the predictive model.
   - [Mine-Rock classifier based on Sonar data inputs](https://github.com/kevinvkasundra/Naval-Mine-Rock-Classifier/blob/master/MineRock.ipynb) : Developed a classifier to differentiate between naval mines and rocks present submerged in ocean using sonar signal inputs (frequency-modulated chirp). Data was analyzed for outliers and identification of missing values. Missing values were imputed usign suitable methods. Succesfully built the model using Logistic regression and Decision tree. Chance of improvement by using advanced classification models.
   - [Data Analytics of Diamond Pricing and its associated features]() : Built a linear regression model in order to accurately predict the diamond prices based on the features. The features are Price, Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Depth, Tabl, X, Y, and Z dimensions. The Data consists of many missing values which are assessed and analysed in order to proceed for model building. Objectives included Metadata Preparation, Outlier Analysis, Missing Value Imputation, New Attribute Creation and Attribute Encoding.
   - Data Analytics and exploration of Diamond pricing in SAS : Performed outlier analysis, missing value imputation, attribute encoding, determined important features responsible for diamond pricing. Performed forward -backward and stepwise linear regressions to predict the diamond pricing.
   - [Prediction of the file claim for an insured car in R](): Built and implemented a claim predictive model where the claim rate was less than 2% of the entire dataset. Data profiling and cleansing along with modifying the data using Resampling techniques followed by PCA. Formulated the classification model using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Linear SVM and Random Forest.
   - [Profiling and Analyzing Yelp Data in SQL](https://github.com/kevinvkasundra/Profiling-and-Analyzing-Yelp-data-using-SQL) : Analyzed and made ratings predictions of various businesses in the Yelp dataset based on texts reviews.
   - [Boston Housing price model]() : Developed a realistic regression model to determine the prices of houses in Boston suburban. Summarized the result to give an in-depth executive summary.
   - [Ranking NFL 2007 teams using Markov Chain]() : Applied W/L score, Random Walk, and difference of W/L points criteria to form transition matrix. 
   - [‘CFD Analysis of Wind Turbine’, Undergrad Thesis Project]() : Analyzed and optimized the attributes affecting the wake region of a Wind Turbine and compared the results with the WInDS code in MATLAB.
   - [Production Demand Forecasting (Long & Short) for Arconic Fastening Systems & Rings (Fortune 250)]() : Implemented Moving average, Exponential smoothing, Croston’s method, ARIMA and Winter Holt’s methods to forecast production demands. Cross verified the forecasts using Facebook Prophet Algorithm.
   - [Inventory Management for VTI of Texas]() : Calculated ‘when and how much’ stock; truck load optimization.
   - [Time Series analysis using Neural Networks]() : 
   - [LA Bicycle Share]() : 
   - [Data Mining]() : 
   - [Google Maps using API]() :
