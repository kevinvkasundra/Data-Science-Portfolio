## Projects: 
- **Machine Learning**

     - [Natural Language Processing using NLTK on eBooks](asd) : There are 8 different text files of ebooks which are available freely on http://www.gutenberg.org/ . Steps Performed: Importing of text files to python, Text Parsing and transformation operations are performed such as lower case conversion, removal of special characters, contraction words, tokenizing etc., Tagging parts of speech to each term, Stemming terms to get their root word, Stop Word Removal. The project also shows the difference in the outcome when POS Tagging, Stop Word Removal and Stemming operations are not performed.

    - [Prediction Analysis of Risky Credit for a credit card company using Neural Networks and Random Forests]() : Developed a model to determine the credit risk for a customer based on the attributes. Performed data imputations using one-hot method. The Random Forest model results the accuracy of 78%, Recall of 93.24%, precision of 80.23% and F1 score of 86.25%. The training model for Random forest however shows 95.71% Accuracy, which shows overfitting of curve. Hence we rely on neural network with Neural Network - 6,5.  

    - [Loan Default predictive modelling for a customer of a Multinational Bank]() : A classification model to accurately detect if a customer is going to default the loan/ credit payments. The goal is to understand the important factors affecting the loan status and building an optimized classification model. I have used kNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Logistic regression algorithm.

    - [Mine-Rock classifier based on Sonar data inputs]() : Utlized a sonar data inputs (signals bouncing off from metal and rock surfaces). I have used analysis for outlier and missing value identification and imputation.  A classification model is built to detect if the signals contribute or predict the presence of a Mine or a Rock.

    - [Data Analytics of Diamond Pricing and its associated features]() : Built a linear regression model in order to accurately predict the diamond prices based on the features. The features are Price, Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Depth, Tabl, X, Y, and Z dimensions. The Data consists of many missing values which are assessed and analysed in order to proceed for model building. Objectives included Metadata Preparation, Outlier Analysis, Missing Value Imputation, New Attribute Creation and Attribute Encoding.

    - Data Analytics and exploration of Diamond pricing [SAS] : Performed outlier analysis, missing value imputation, attribute encoding, determined important features responsible for diamond pricing. Performed forward -backward and stepwise linear regressions to predict the diamond pricing
    
    - Prediction of the file claim for an insured car [R] : Achieved 84% accuracy with sensitivity of 73%. Analyzed 1,00,000 observations and 52 factors with 6.2% missing values. 12 Important features selected (Subset selection, Ridge and LASSO)

- **Visualization**
   
    
- **Micro Projects**
   
    - **Phase 1 Analysis of Multivariate Quality Control Data for an Industrial Forging Process :** Estimated distribution parameters from within control data point to use it as monitoring scheme for future quality control missions (Phase 2 Analysis). 
    
     Performed data organization, advanced visualization, mapping, enterprise dashboards, and data presentation
